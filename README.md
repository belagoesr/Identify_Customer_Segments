# Identify_Customer_Segments

In this project, two datasets from Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions are analyzed, one with 
demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales 
company. 

The purpose is to look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, 
and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

The project is divided in 3 major sections: 

1. **Preprocessing**:  Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning

2. **Feature Transformation**: Perform principal component analysis (PCA) to identify relationships between variables in the dataset

3. **Clustering**: Apply k-means method to cluster the demographic data into groups
